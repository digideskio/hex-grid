Canvas representation of grids for eclecticmeme.com tiled map - see https://github.com/Techbot/JiGS-PHP-RPG-engine

TO DO:

So far only one "map" consisting of primary grid (1, center), and its 3 adjacent grids (2,3,4) with adjoining portals, is represented.

I would like to generate the entire map (40+ grids) and display their adjacent grids (with numbers) and adjoining portals (showing portal type 1-3).
